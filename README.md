- Every time you input, your baby bot will try to learn your word. After few seconds your babt will learn it and tell you what they want.

### Auto-train and feedback

Everytime your baby learn a new utterance from you, it will trigger auto-retrain.

### Limitation

Because this project is just a POC (Proof of Concept), so it still don't support for multiple user online.

It might have some issues if multiple user on line.
